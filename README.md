A variable of the primitive data type boolean can have two values: true and false (Boolean literals). or off. Boolean expressions use relational and logical operators. The result of a Boolean expression is either true or false.
They connect your search words together to either narrow or broaden your set of results. The three basic boolean operators are: AND, OR, and NOT.
As well as a standard Boolean Expression, the input and output information of any Logic Gate or circuit can be plotted into standard Boolean Algebra truth tables to give a visual representation of the switching function of the system.

The table used to represent the boolean expression of a logic gate function is commonly called a Truth Table. A logic gate truth table shows each possible input combination to the gate or circuit with the resultant output depending upon the combination of these input(s).

For example, consider a single 2-input logic circuit with input variables labelled as A and B. There are “four” possible input combinations or 22 of “OFF” and “ON” for the two inputs. However, when dealing with Boolean expressions and especially logic gate truth tables, we do not general use “ON” or “OFF” but instead give them bit values which represent a logic level “1” or a logic level “0” respectively.

Then the four possible combinations of A and B for a 2-input logic gate is given as:

Input Combination 1. – “OFF” – “OFF” or ( 0, 0 )
Input Combination 2. – “OFF” – “ON” or ( 0, 1 )
Input Combination 3. – “ON” – “OFF” or ( 1, 0 )
Input Combination 4. – “ON” – “ON” or ( 1, 1 )

The '=' is the so-called assignment operator and is used to assign the result of the expression on the right side of the operator to the variable on the left side. The '==' is the so-called equality comparison operator and is used to check whether the two expressions on both sides are equal or not.
True and False, using capital T and F, with the rest of the word in lowercase.
